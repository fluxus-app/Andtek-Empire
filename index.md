          title: GROW (dont get suck)
          description: Being a Freelancer means you have to learn by yourself as well as being multi-skilled & multi-tasking. Is not just about what you do best, you’ll need also organization, management, marketing and sales skills. Fluxus will automate tedious processes while helping you increase your network. You’ll find people to learn from, people you can collaborate with, and maybe even your soul mate.

          title: SAVE TIME
          description: Flexibility is an illusion that offers control in exchange for a demanding responsibility. Being a freelancer doesn’t mean you have to work more than an office guy. Fluxus will save you enough time so you can keep a healthy work/life balance. But if you’re workalchoolic, then you’ll have more time to be twice productive.

          title: GAIN STABILITY
          description: Freelancing is naturally cyclical, there are times with too much work and there are times without any work. Financially is the same, so income is variable. Fluxus will let you have continuous work, which means stable income.
